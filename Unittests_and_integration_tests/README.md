# Unittests and Integration Tests

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of unit and integration testing in Python. The focus is on testing individual functions with unit tests and end-to-end code paths with integration tests. Key concepts such as mocking, parameterization, and fixtures are also covered.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the difference between unit and integration tests.
- Apply common testing patterns like mocking, parameterization, and fixtures.
- Write and execute tests using the `unittest` framework.
- Use the `parameterized` library to simplify repetitive test cases.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- All Python files should follow the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5).
- Each file must end with a newline.
- The first line of every file should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- All code should be executable.
- Every module, class, and function should include documentation.
- Functions and coroutines must have type annotations.
